# Course Suggestion System

## Overview

The Course Suggestion System is a C++ project designed to recommend courses for the next semester based on the user's completed courses. It analyzes the user's academic history and suggests relevant courses to help them progress in their academic journey.

## Features

* **User Input**
    * Allows users to input their completed courses.
* **Course Database**
    * Stores information about available courses, including prerequisites and course descriptions.
* **Recommendation Algorithm**
    * Analyzes the user's completed courses and suggests relevant courses for the next semester.
* **Interactive Interface** (Optional)
    * Provides a user-friendly interface for viewing course recommendations and selecting preferred options.

## Usage

1. **Compile**
   ```sh
   git clone [https://github.com/Basharul2002/AIUB-Course-Suggestion-System.git] (https://github.com/Basharul2002/AIUB-Course-Suggestion-System.git)
   cd course-suggestion-system

   # Assuming your main program is named main.cpp
   g++ main.cpp -o course_suggestion
